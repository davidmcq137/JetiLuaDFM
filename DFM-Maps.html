  <h2>GPS Maps Display</h2>
  <p>Displays the model's flightpath on the TX screen overlaid on Google maps images of your flying field. Automatically zooms to fit flightpath.</p>
  <p>You can set up multiple circular or polygonal no-fly zones which can be no-fly inside or no-fly outside. There is a warning when approaching a no-fly zone, and an audio and tactile (stick shaker) alert available when crossing into a no-fly zone</p>
  <p>The model's flight path history is available up to 600 points and this trail can be color-coded with various parameters of interest such as antenna signal, altitude, or speed</p>
  <p>There is a companion website that creates map sets for your flying fields and creates a Jeti Studio "App store" with your fields and your maps for easy downloads to your transmitter</p>
  <p>We also support creation of a GPS Triangle race "track" and navigation of your model around the track by voice command along with Triangle race scorekeeping</p>
