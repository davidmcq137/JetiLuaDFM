  <h1>DFM-Crow.lua</h1>
  <p>
      Create a mixing curve that corrects pitch trim over the range of crow. Inspired by the OpenTX implementation done by Mike Shellim. 
<p>
Version 1.6
<p>
Now allows logcial switch for crow control.

  <h2>Adaptive Crow Trim Mixing</h2>
  <p>This app is used to create a pitch trim curve to be mixed with the elevator control so that pitch trim is compensated across the entire range of Crow.</p>
<p>
The crow mixing controls can be set to any proportional controls, or with a few additional steps and creating a flight mode, it is possible to use the original digital trim buttons</p>
<p>
The app creates a mix curve with pilot-specified spacing (linear or log) and a selctable number of points. The crow trim compensation can be set for each of these points and values in between points are interpolated. 
</p>
<p>
There is also an autotrim-like capability, called autocrow, where the trim is adjusted by movement of the elevator stick.
</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>In the main menu, assign the controls for crow and crow trim</p>
   <li>
      <p>In the settings menu confirm the values of trim step (how far the trim value moves for each press of the crow control</p>
<li>If you want to use autocrow, use that menu to select an on/off switch to enable autocrow, set the elevator control, and confirm rate and expo settings
    </li>
  </ol>
