-- CTRL_l is the list of lua controls to use. controls must be between 1-10
-- but can start at other than 1, skip etc. For example {2,3,4,5,6} or {3,7,8,9,10}
-- to account for other lua programs having pre-defined controls
-- all CTRL_x list will be traversed in the same order as this list

CTRL_l {
   6,7,8,9
}

-- long names of controls .. whatever you like, 31 char limit

CTRL_n {
       "Aileron", "Flap", "Rudder", "Elevator"
}

-- short names of controls, 3 chars max, names must match up with CTRL_st names

CTRL_sn {
   "Ail", "Flp", "Rud", "Ele"
}

-- control states for each time step, dt in ms, states must be -1..1
-- dt is time to next step
-- only have to specify changes after first step
-- rows can be in any order, and all controls can move in each row
-- controls in a row can be in any order
-- make dt 2x as long for -1 to 1 as for 0 to 1
