    <p class="ShortDescription">
	Define and track the usage of groups of battery packs
    </p>
    <p>
        Allows pilot to define multiple groups of battery packs and select a
        group for each model. On startup of the model, pops up a window to
        select one or more battery packs from the selected group for that
        flight.

    <h2>Release Notes</h2>
    <p>
	Version 2.4 Update: Maximum battery capacity has been increased from
	9999 mAh to 32767 mAh to accommodate new high-capacity batteries
    </p>
    <p>
	Version 2.2 Update : There is a new key defined on the popup screen where
	you select a battery group, called "+Batt". This allows selection of
	multiple batteries. When the popup is displayed, position the cursor to
	what you consider the primary battery ... the app will read capacity and
	warning levels from this battery. If you press OK it will be selected as
	the one battery as the app has worked before. If you press "+Batt" it
	will select this battery as primary and re-load the menu where you can
	position the cursor to a second battery and press enter, selecting a
	second battery. You can repeat this as many times as you like. All
	selected batteries will be announced with an audio announcement, and all
	will have their cycle count incremented.
    </p>
    <p>
	Also, for Version 2.2, we've added a key in the group setup screen to
	delete a battery group. 
    </p>
    <p>
	Note: If you downloaded the original version, the file is
	DFM-Batt.lua. The newer versions are DFM-Batt.lc. If you see DFM-Batt
	listed twice when adding an app, you still have the old DFM-Batt.lua
	file .. you may want to delete it. The old app will come up as version
	1.0 in the Applications menu if you want to confirm. This was done to
	allow the app to continue to work on the older mono TX devices.
