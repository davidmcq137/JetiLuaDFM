    <p class="ShortDescription">
	Create two mixing curves that correct knife edge trim for aileron and
	elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
	Once established with the app, the values can be transferred
	to a built-in mix curve.

    <h2>Adaptive Knife EdgeMixing</h2>
    <p>This app is used to create a pitch and a roll trim curve to be mixed with
    the elevator and aileron controls so that aileron and elevator trim is
    compensated across the entire range of rudder motion in knife-edge flight.</p>
    <p>
	The aileron and elevator mixing controls can be set to be any proportional controls.
    </p>
    <p>
	There is an instructional video by Harry Curzon on how to set up and use
	this app, check out Harry's Youtube channel
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
	<li>Assign the main control (e.g. Rudder) and make sure to set it to proportional</li>
	<li>Assign the controls for Rudder, Aileron and Alevator, they also must
	be set to proportional</li>
	<li>Assign a switch to enable adjustment of the Elevator (Automix Elevator control)</li>
	<li>Assign a switch to enable adjustment of the Aileron (Automix Aileron control)</li>
	<li>You may wish to set the Aileron and Elevator switches to the same
	physical switch</li>
    </ol>
