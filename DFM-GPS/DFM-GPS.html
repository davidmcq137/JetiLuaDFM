    <h1>DFM-GPS.lua</h1>
    <p>
	A GPS display app that shows the model and no fly zones for the selected
	field on the transmitter screen. As it is primarily intended for the Gen
	1 (Monochrome) screens, image display is not possible. Use DFM-Maps for
	that purpose. There is also a color drawing module for newer
	transmitters, the correct drawing module is loaded when the application
	starts. No fly zones are created using our map generator program which
	can be found on the web at www.jetiluaDFM.app
    </p>
    <p>
	Version 0.7

    <h2>GPS Map display app</h2>
    <p>
	In addition to displaying the flying area (the screen automatically
	zooms to capture the flight path), the app can also display speed and
	altitude "tapes" on the sides of the screens if the altitude and speed
	telemetry values are assigned.
    <p>
	When the app is started for the first time, it will ask for the
	telemetry assignments for Lat and Long and Speed and Altitude if
	desired. It will not pop up this screen on subsequent runs. If you do
	want to force the telemetry assignment screen to come up, hold the right
	hand control stick in the lower left corner (full left and full up on
	Mode II).
    </p>
    <p>
	The app will also pop up a selection menu of the field files that are
	stored on the TX (created by our website) and will allow you to choose
	one .. or none.
    </p>
    <p>
	There is an instructional video by Harry Curzon on how to set up and use
	this app, check out Harry's Youtube channel
