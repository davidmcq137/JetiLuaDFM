ok, here is my take on minimizing computation while calculating a
slope (derivative) on a data stream.

start with the simple formula for slope of a line fit to a set of
points:

m = sum( ( x[i]-xbar) * (y[i]-ybar) ) / sum( x[i] - xbar)^2)

where the sum is from 1 to n points

and xbar = sum(x)/n and ybar = sum(y)/n

since x is just a repeating set of time steps we can show with a
little algebra that

xbar = dt * (n+1) / 2

since we know that our x spacing is always the same, call it dt (in
your case I think 0.010 secs) then we can compute much of this formula
statically .. for example the denominator, let's call it den, with a
little more algebra, is:

den = dt*dt*(sumk2(n) - n*(n+1)*(n+1)/4)

where sumk2(n) = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/6 .. the sum of squares from 1 to n

Here is a table of sumk2 vs n

n       sumk2
--------------
2	0.5
3	2.0
4	5.0
5	10.0
6	17.5
7	28.0
8	42.0
9	60.0
10	82.5
11	110.0
12	143.0
13	182.0
14	227.5
15	280.0
16	340.0

We also note that the x[i]-xbar part of the sum in the numerator is
essentially just a constant weighting vector the same each time we loop,

wv[1..n] = { -(n+1)/2 + 1, ....,(n+1)/2 -1,  (n+1)/2 - 1}

or, said another way...

for i=1,n
  wv[i] = -(n+1)/2 + i
end

that is, wv goes from -(n+1)/2 to +(n+1)/2 by steps of 1. Again, a
loop-invariant value..wv is computed and filled in once at initialization.

so all we are left with is the loop in the numerator which just n
iteratons of a few multiplies, and you can use your existing running
average for y (in your case this is the pitot speed) for ybar. you do have
to keep the last n values of y in an array or ring buffer if you are not already...

then we have:

numerator = dt * sum ( wv[i] * (y[i] - ybar) ) -- where sum is a loop from 1..n

demoninator = dt*dt*(sumk2(n) - n*(n+1)*(n+1)/4)

slope = (numerator / demoninator) / dt

nice that the time spacing comes out so simply at the end if you want real units.

of course if you don't care about units, and are ok with a deriv in
arbitrary units, you can toss out dt so long as its constant, and toss
out the whole denominator since it's just a constant for a given n.

so, I think this is pretty simple.. but let me know what you think.
