Summary:

Use this menu to set the speed values and the warnings for each of the V
speeds. The overspeed warnings will be triggered as soon as the aircraft exceeds
them.

Vaa is the *airspeed alive* speed and Vne is the *never exceed* speed.

The underspeed warnings will not be armed until the aircraft slightly exceeds
the warning speed and will then trigger when the speed drops below the warning
speed.

Vso is the *stall speed*, Vref is the *normal approach speed* typically 1.3 times
Vso. Vmca is the *minimum controllable airspeed* for a twin-engine aircraft with
one engine operating, and Vmcw is a *warning speed* intended to be set just above
Vmca.

For each warning you can select stick shakers (left or right, various shake
patterns) and/or an audio warning. You can also select neither warning to ignore
the V speed.
