Summary of Commands:

- Throttle Control
- Sync Enable Switch

On this menu you tell the app which channel on the transmitter is used to
control the throttle. It uses the standard Jeti control setting
screen. Typically this would be P4 for a Mode II setup. In a twin engine model
you would have a mixer that mixed the Left Engine (engine 1) throttle to the
RRight Engine (engine 2).

The Sync enable switch is used to turn twin engine synch on and off. It uses the
standard Jeti switch selection screen.
