Summary of commands:

- Left RPM
- Right RPM
- Left Temp
- Right Temp

On this menu you can assign the telemetry sensors for RPM and Temperature for
each engine. This is done with the usual Jeti sensor selection dialog.

For single-engine aircraft it is preferred to use the Left engine as the single
engine and leave the right engine unassigned.
