Summary:

This command displays a graph showing all the data points that were connected by
the second telemetry window, displaying RPM on the vertical axis and Throttle
percentage on the horizontal.

When softkey 2 (Thr) is selected, the 2D wheel moves the vertical line left and
right to select only the points to the left of the line. When softkey 3 (Exp) is
selected, the 3D wheel moves the exponential value of the curve fit.

Softkey 4 (Fit) performs a fit to the selected part of the curve.

Softkey 1 (Save) saves the fit parameters for use in the Throttle to RPM
prediction routine that confirms normal engine operation.

Softkey 5 (Ok) returns to the Flight Engineer main menu.
