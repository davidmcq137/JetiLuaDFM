  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
      DFM-Dial was suggested by Harry Curzon as a simple app that could format
      graphical representations of telemetry data in the Jeti transmitter's
      telemetry windows. It can do arc and needle dials, horizontal bargraphs
      and chart-recorder style time recordings.
  </p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>Like all Jeti lua apps, DFM-Graph can have two
      telemetry windows defined. After the app is added to the Applications menu
      for a model, the pilot has to define one or two telemetry windows by going
      first to the Timer/Sensors menu, then to the Displayed Telemetry menu. On
      this menu press the "+" key and then "Lua" and pick one of the two menus
      from the app .. you can then press "+" again and select a second one.
  </p>
  <p>
      Once the two windows are defined, you can use the App's menu structure to
      set up each of the two telemetry windows. Each window can have several
      different screens from the standard single-telemetry channel double size
      window all the way up to a few 4-telemetry channel windows. Once you have
      selected the window, press F3 (the edit button) to pick the sensor(s) for
      that set of window panes. Then press F3 again to set up each of the sensor
      windows.
  </p>
  <p>
      In order to more easily set up max and min values there is a value and
      multiplier. As usual, when editing the values, the menu key allows x1, x10
      and x100 from the base increment on the 3D wheel. The multiplier applies
      to both the gauge range (Max/Min displayed value) and the Warning value,
      typically less in absolute value than the max or min. When the telemetry
      value is outside the warning or gauge range, the main displayed numerical
      value turns red.
  </p>
  <p>
      You can also apply an n-point running average with an exponentially
      decaying weighting by specifying the smoothing value. 1 is no smoothing, 2
      is a 2-point running average, etc.
