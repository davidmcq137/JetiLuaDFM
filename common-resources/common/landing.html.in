        <h1>Dave and Harry's Jeti Lua Apps</h1>
        <p class="lp-indent">
          Extending the functions of the Jeti RC systems can provide significant
          new capabilities, especially in the use of telemetry sensors.  This is
          the home page for a collaboration between Dave McQueeney and Harry
          Curzon for a series of Jeti apps that we have developed to further our
          interests in our RC aircraft hobby.  Harry also has
          a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cotswoldpilot">YouTube
          channel </a>with information and tutorials on the use of Jeti systems.

	<p>
	To access these apps in Jeti Studio, open the Jeti Studio File menu,
	then the Configuration menu and add this URL to the list ot
	repositories:
          <span style="outline: 2px solid tomato">__to be added before shipping to production__</span>
	</p>
	<p>
	  NOTE: If you had the original repository string in your configuration
	  (http://jetimodel.nl/DFMHC/Apps.json), you must remove that original
	  string and replace it with the one above. It will create an error message
	  from Jeti studio if you have both the old and new repository strings
	  in the Configuration, since both repositories have the same apps in
	  them and Jeti studio does not allow duplicate app names.

	<h3>DFM-InsP - Instrument Panel Creation and Display
          <a target="_blank" href="/gauges">(go to panel creator)</a>
        </h3>
	<div class="lp-indent">
	    <p>
		Our latest release is a web-based app that creates instrument
		panels along with a companion app that can be installed on the
		Jeti Transmitter. A variety of instrument types are available,
		including round needle and arc gauges, bar gauges, a chart
		recorder and an artificial horizon that can be used with Jeti
		Assist receivers -- and many more. For total flexibility, you
		can also draw all the artwork for an instrument panel with a
		separate stand-alone graphics app and then place active gauge
		components (for example needles and arcs) on the panel image.</p>
	    <p>
		Similar to our DFM-Maps app, pilots can create an individual set
		of instrument panels and then create an app source for use with
		the Transmitter Wizard and its Lua App manager. The app,
		DFM-InsP, will be downloaded along with the individual set of
		instrument panels created on the website. When you press Create
		App Source, all the panels in the My Panels section will be
		prepared for download along with the app</p>
	    <p>
		On our website you will see a number of example panels that can
		be used as-is or modified to your preference. You can also
		create an empty panel and make a completely custom
		configuration. Each of the example panels has documentation that
		describes the panel and talks about what is unique or
		interesting about it. These documents are also available on the
		transmitter.</p>
	    <p>
	        If you create your own panel, you can write the documentation
	    for it just as we have done with the examples. When your panel is
	    finished you can export the it to a json file and share it with
	    others - they would use the Import panel json option to read it
	    in. The documentation is included in the json file along with the
	    panel itself.</p>
	    <p>
		Each app, when installed in a model, can have two telemetry
	    windows. This allows display of two instrument panels at any one
	    time, but the app also has a built-in sequencer that will change the
	    instrument panels displayed according to the state of switches and
	    controls on the transmitter, allowing the appropriate panel to be
		displayed for all phases of flight.

        <h3>DFM-Maps - Flight Display
          <a target="_blank" href="/create-maps">(go to maps creator)</a>
        </h3>

	<div class="lp-indent">
	    <p>
		Our first release on this site is a flight display app (DFM-Maps) that can overlay your aircraft's flight pattern on a series of Google maps images while flying.
		We have a website where you can create a set of maps for your flying field(s).
		These maps can include a runway, a set of circular or polygonal no-fly zones, and even a GPS triangle race course.

            <h4>Setup</h4>
            <div class="lp-indent">
		<p>To install DFM-Maps, you will need to use our web setup tool - <a target="_blank" href="/create-maps">click here to open it. </a>
		</p>
		<p>Then, after following these three steps, you will have the app up and running with maps for your field!</p>
		<ol>
		    <li>
			<span class="lp-step">Create the field information</span>
			<p>Navigate so that your flying field is in the middle of the map, and click "New field at map center".</p>
			<p>If you can't find the field, you can right-click anywhere on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps">regular Google maps</a> to copy a lat/long, which you can paste into our tool at the lower left. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			<span class="lp-step">Create your JETI repository</span>
			<p>When you are happy with the field, click "Create JETI repository". </p>
			<p>This will create for you a unique URL which you can add as a repository in <a href="https://www.jetimodel.com/support/jeti-studio/jeti-studio.html">JETI Studio</a>. The repository is unique to you - it includes both the app itself, and your field data. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			<span class="lp-step">Install DFM-Maps with <a href="https://www.jetimodel.com/support/jeti-studio/jeti-studio.html">JETI Studio</a>
			</span>
			<p>In JETI Studio, open File &gt; Configuration &gt; App Sources, and paste your repository URL.</p>
			<p>Then use the Lua App Manager to download the app and your maps to your transmitter.</p>
		    </li>
		</ol>
		<p>When you load the DFM-Maps app into one of your models, it will display the set of images for the field where the aircraft is located, and while flying it will overlay the aircraft's position on the map in the transmitter's screen. It will also warn of upcoming no-fly zones, and can announce verbally or via a stick shaker a no-fly breach. It can even verbally direct you to fly around a <a href="https://gps-triangle.net/">GPS triangle</a> race course. </p>
