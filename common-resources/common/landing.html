        <h1>Dave and Harry's Jeti Lua Apps</h1>
        <p class="lp-indent">
          Extending the functions of the Jeti RC systems can provide significant
          new capabilities, especially in the use of telemetry sensors.  This is
          the home page for a collaboration between Dave McQueeney and Harry
          Curzon for a series of Jeti apps that we have developed to further our
          interests in our RC aircraft hobby.  Harry also has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cotswoldpilot">YouTube channel </a>with information and tutorials on the use of Jeti systems.

	<h3>DFM-InsP - Instrument Panel Creation and Display</h3>

	<div class="lp-indent">
	    <p>
		Our latest release is web-based app that creates instrument
		panels that can be installed on the Jeti Transmitter. A variety
		of instrument types is available, including round needle and arc
		gauges, bar gauges, a chart recorder and an artificial horizon
		that can be used with Jeti Assist receivers -- and many more.</p>
	    <p>
		Similar to our DFM-Maps app, pilots can create an individual set
		of instrument panels and then create an app source for use with
		the Transmitter Wizard and its Lua App manager. The app,
		DFM-InsP.lua, will be downloaded along with the individual set
		of instrument panels created on the website.</p>
	    <p>
		Each app, when installed in a model, can have two telemetry
	    windows. This allows display of two instrument panels at any one
	    time, but the app also has a built-in sequencer that will change the
	    instrument panels displayed according to the state of switches and
	    controls on the transmitter, allowing the appropriate panel to be
	    displayed for all phases of flight.</p>

        <h3>DFM-Maps - Flight Display</h3>

	<div class="lp-indent">
	    <p>
		Our first release on this site is a flight display app (DFM-Maps) that can overlay your aircraft's flight pattern on a series of Google maps images while flying.
		We have a website where you can create a set of maps for your flying field(s).
		These maps can include a runway, a set of circular or polygonal no-fly zones, and even a GPS triangle race course.

            </div>
            <h4>Setup</h4>
            <div class="lp-indent">
		<p>To install DFM-Maps, you will need to use our web setup tool - <a target="_blank" href="/create-maps">click here to open it. </a>
		</p>
		<p>Then, after following these three steps, you will have the app up and running with maps for your field!</p>
		<ol>
		    <li>
			<span class="lp-step">Create the field information</span>
			<p>Navigate so that your flying field is in the middle of the map, and click "New field at map center".</p>
			<p>If you can't find the field, you can right-click anywhere on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps">regular Google maps</a> to copy a lat/long, which you can paste into our tool at the lower left. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			<span class="lp-step">Create your JETI repository</span>
			<p>When you are happy with the field, click "Create JETI repository". </p>
			<p>This will create for you a unique URL which you can add as a repository in <a href="https://www.jetimodel.com/support/jeti-studio/jeti-studio.html">JETI Studio</a>. The repository is unique to you - it includes both the app itself, and your field data. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			<span class="lp-step">Install DFM-Maps with <a href="https://www.jetimodel.com/support/jeti-studio/jeti-studio.html">JETI Studio</a>
			</span>
			<p>In JETI Studio, open File &gt; Configuration &gt; App Sources, and paste your repository URL.</p>
			<p>Then use the Lua App Manager to download the app and your maps to your transmitter.</p>
		    </li>
		</ol>
		<p>When you load the DFM-Maps app into one of your models, it will display the set of images for the field where the aircraft is located, and while flying it will overlay the aircraft's position on the map in the transmitter's screen. It will also warn of upcoming no-fly zones, and can announce verbally or via a stick shaker a no-fly breach. It can even verbally direct you to fly around a <a href="https://gps-triangle.net/">GPS triangle</a> race course. </p>
