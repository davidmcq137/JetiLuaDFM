    <h2>Instrument Panel Display App</h2>
    <p>
	Once an instrument panel is defined on the website, it can be downloaded
	to the transmitter with the Lua App manager in Jeti Studio.
    </p>
    <p>
	After installing the app on the transmitter, sensors, controls and lua
	expressions can be assigned to the gauges, lights and textboxes to
	animate them with live sensor information.
    </p>
    <p>
	There will an instructional video by Harry Curzon on how to set up and
	use this app, check out Harry's Youtube channel when it's published. In
	the meantime, there are some simple intro videos in a
	<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBF3sPcOSMrTpT-6mnvzvY7HhVcIDdomK">playlist</a>
	available on Dave's channel.
