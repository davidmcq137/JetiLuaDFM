    <h2>Instrument Panel Display App</h2>
    <p>
	Once an instrument panel is defined on the website, it can be downloaded
	to the transmitter with the Lua App manager in Jeti Studio.
    </p>
    <p>
	After installing the app on the transmitter, sensors, controls and lua
	expressions can be assigned to the gauges, lights and textboxes to
	animate them with live sensor information.
    </p>
    <p>
	There are instructional vides by Harry Curzon on how to set up and
	use this app, check out Harry's Youtube channel.
