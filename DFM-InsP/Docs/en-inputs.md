On this menu you assign a sensor, a TX control or a lua expression to drive the
value of a displayed widget (a gauge or textbox or panel light). Assigning a
control can be convenient for testing (for example assigning the throttle
control to drive a gauge), or to assign a logical switch to a panel light.

You can also enter a lua expression to drive the widget which allows complex
mathematical expressions made of lua variables (which are assigned to sensors)
and built-in functions to drive a gauge or display a text value.
