Colors on the website are selected from a standard set of web CSS colors. These
color names can be found at this link: [Color List]
(http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color)

You can add colors of your own with names and RGB values to use in the panel
editor. Since we don't have the list above available in the panel editor, and we
expect only limited editing of colors, this provides a simple way to edit a
smaller list of colors than the CSS standard.
