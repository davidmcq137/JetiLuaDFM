The panel editor will display a panel _live_ and will position a crosshair over
the center of the widget (panel element) being edited. The Select button cycles
through the widgets. The second button selects which property to edit, and the
third button selects which element of that property to edit.

Some items such as labels and text box contents can be edited with the
transmitter's text edit function, for these the fourth button _Edit_ will be
shown as available.

Status and other useful information is displayed on the gray bar at the bottom of the screen.
