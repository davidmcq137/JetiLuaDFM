This menu allows you to set up state transitions from one panel to another using
switches. Multiple lines can be created allowing complex sequences to be
described.

Sw indicates the switch which will drive the transition, it is assigned using
the usual Jeti switch assignment menu. One note .. you must leave the switch in
the active position when you leave switch assignment, and for momentary switches
this means you have to hold it in the active position when exiting the switch
assignment screen.

Trig can be + or - and tells the app which direction of switching is intended to
activate the transition.

From is the panel the app must be displaying when the switch is activated, it
can be an asterisk (*) if you want the transition to occur from any panel.

To is the panel to which the view should shift when the switch triggers. An
asterisk here makes the line effectively a no-op .. it just switches to itself.
