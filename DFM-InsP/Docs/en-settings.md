These settings are global, they apply to all panels across the app.

The switch to reset min and max can be assigned and when pressed/activated, it
will reset the little _bugs_ that track the minimum and maximum value of a
gauge.

The switch to _rotate_ panels will cause the next panel in the panels list to be
displayed on the primary screen, and will also put its secondary panel on
telemetry window 2 which is reached with the right arrow key from telemetry
window 1 .. the main window.

If you want to reset all app data, removing all panels, settings, lua variables,
etc then you select this menu item and answer yes to the confirmation
panel. After that you must restart the app. The simplest way to do this is to
switch off the transmitter and when it asks if you are sure, say no .. this
restarts all the apps.
