This is the lua expression editor. You use the 3D wheel to scroll the list of
numbers, functions, variables and operators back and forth. The highlighted
symbol will be included in the expression if you press enter while it is
highlighted. Note that some common symbols are assigned to softkeys to speed up
the input process.
