DFM-InsP is the companion app to the Instrument Panel Creator website available
at www.jwtiluadfm.app/gauges.

- Help screens such as this one will be available on some screens on Softkey 1
  with the help icon, and on all screens with the __Menu__ button on the TX.

- You start on the website by modifying one of the example panels, or starting
  from scratch with the Empty panel. You can create as many panels as you
  like.

- When you are ready to transfer the panels and the app to the transmitter, you
  press the __Create app source__ button which will give you a link to paste
  into the Jeti studio app sources tab available under the Configuration menu.
