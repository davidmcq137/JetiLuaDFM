This is an adaptation of the Turbine Panel that Harry C. did. He has done some
edits to things like the color bar width and gauge colors to make it more
readable and interesting, and has included a sequenced text box for status
information. By removing the fuel state horizontal bar he was able to make the
gauge faces larger.
