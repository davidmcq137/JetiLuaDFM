This panel demonstrates the Chart Recorder widget. It has a two trace chart
recorder constructed from stacking two one-trace chart recorder widgets on on
top of the other. You can look at the example and see that if you specify a
widget as chart recorder trace 1 it will include the bacground, but traces 2-4
omit the background to facilitate stacking.

You should take special care to ensure that all the stacked traces have the same
time axis.

While these widgets are usually displayed full screen they can be shrunk if
desired.
