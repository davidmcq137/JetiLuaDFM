#PreFlightCBox

This is a rather busy panel with some very dense information. Since it is
intended to be looked at during preflight (on the ground) that is ok. It
demonstrates the sequenced text box with a lua f(x) extension, some more
sophisticated string interpolation, and gauges to evaluate critical battery
properties at startup. If you add the min/max 'bug' indicators to the gauges,
especially the current gauges, you can move all the controls and check for
binding which would give high max current readings.
