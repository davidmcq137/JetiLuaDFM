  <p class="ShortDescription">
      V-SensXF is based on the excellent Jeti V-Sensor app, the XF refers to extended functions.

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>The main extensions to Jeti's V-Sensor are:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><p>An arbitrary number of telemetry variables can be defined and named using the Telemetry Sensors menu. These variables can then be used in expressions to create live computed results. Expressions are defined in the Result Expressions menu.</p></li>
      <li><p>GPS sensors may be defined, along with GPS points on the GPS Sensors and GPS Points menus</p></li>
      <li><p>We have added a number of special functions to the environment of the Lua interpreter that is used to evaluate the Lua expressions. See the help screen on the Results Expressions menu for more information. For example we have GPS distance and bearing functions, no fly inside and outside functions, and a knob and slider reading function to adjust parameters during flight.</p></li>
      <li><p>Results can be displayed in telemetry windows and can be set to single or double size telemetry windows with the TX Displayed Telemetry menu. You can assign specific results to specific telemetry windows with the Telemetry Windows menu.</p></li>
      <li><p>Results are logged to the logfile up to the max number your transmitter permits (10 for Gen 1 monochome devices, 24 for others).</p></li>
      <li><p>Results can have Lua controls associated with them. These are set with the Lua controls menu. The limit for the number Lua controls is 4 on Gen 1 devices, and 10 for others. This allow interaction with the TX programming by using a Lua control to drive a logic switch or any other function that allows Lua controls.</p></li>
      <li><p>You can have an arbitrary number of result expressions, but the telemetry windows, log entries and Lua controls are limited to the numbers available on the TX depending on its capacity as noted above.</p></li>
  </ul>
