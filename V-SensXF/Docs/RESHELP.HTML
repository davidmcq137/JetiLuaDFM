<h1 class="title">Result Expressions</h1>
</header>
<p>You may enter for the result any lua expression that could occur as the return value of a function. If the returned value after evaluating the result expression is a number, it will be used as the result. If the return value is a boolean, the value of result will be 1 for true and 0 for false.</p>
<p>The telemetry values assigned in the telemetry sensor screens are put in variables tn where n is the number of a telemetry sensor, for example t1, t2, t3. They are used in expressions as normal variables and their value is kept up to date with the current value of the telemetry senor by a lua loop running continuously.</p>
<p>Several standard math functions from the lua math library are included. These are: abs, sin, cos, atan, rad and deg. We have also added three special functions, step, box and pc.</p>
<p>The step function has three arguments: a1, a2, a3. step(a1,a2,a3) returns 0 when abs(a1-a2) &lt;= abs(a3). It returns -1 when abs(a1-a2) &gt; abs(a3) and a2-a1 is positive. It returns 1 when abs(a1-a2) &gt; abs(a3) and a2-a1 is negative.</p>
<p>The box function also has three arguments and works similarly to step, except that it returns 0 when abs(a1-a2) &lt;= abs(a3) and 1 otherwise.</p>
<p>The pc function is used to include the value proportional controls in the expression. It can have one, two or three arguments. With one argument a1 the value of pc(a1) is the value of proportional control a1 in the standard -1 to 1 range. With two arguments pc(a1, a2) also reads out control a1 but the value of the function goes from 0 t o a2. With three arguments pc(a1,a2,a3) also reads out control a1 b ut the value of the function goes from a2 to a3.</p>
<p>If you need to use units that are not in the Jeti text entry menu we have defined special escape sequences for these units. They are .p for the percent symbol (%), and .o for the degree symbol (°).</p>
<p>For example entering a unit string of .oC will display °C as the unit string in the telemetry window and expression editing screen.</p>
<p>If you press them Menu key with the Result Expressions screen displayed (note the help symbol on softkey 1), the app will read the file V-SensXF/Exp.jsn which contains pre-defined expressions for some common use cases (e.g. watts for electic motors, glide ratio for sailplanes). Select the line you want to copy into the expression to create this result and the app will copy in the expression, the name and the units for you. It will overwrite anything that was on the expression line before.</p>
<p>You can edit the file Exp.jsn to add up to six pre-defined equations along with names and units. Note that you will have to go to the Telemetry Sensors menu to select and name sensors to match the variable names used in the pre-defined equations. You will be changing the default names for example t1, t2 to the variable names used in the Exp.jsn file (for example Volts, Current for the Watts expression).</p>
