<h1 class="title">Result Expressions</h1>
</header>
<p>You may enter for the result any lua expression that could occur as the return value of a function. If the returned value after evaluating the result expression is a number, it will be used as the result. If the return value is a boolean, the value of result will be 1 for true and 0 for false.</p>
<p>The telemetry values assigned in the telemetry sensor screens are put in variables which by defualt are named tn where n is the number of a telemetry sensor, for example t1, t2, t3. You can also edit these variable names to whatever you like so long as it complies with the rules for lua variables. They are used in expressions as any normal lua variables and their value is kept up to date with the current value of the telemetry senor by a lua loop running continuously.</p>
<p>Several standard math functions from the lua math library are included. These are: abs, sin, cos, atan, rad, deg, sqrt, max, min and floor. We have also added special functions: step, box, pc, sign, gpsd, gpsb, nfi and nfo. These special functions are defined below.</p>
<p>The step function has three arguments: a1, a2, a3. step(a1,a2,a3) returns 0 when abs(a1-a2) &lt;= abs(a3). It returns -1 when abs(a1-a2) &gt; abs(a3) and a2-a1 is positive. It returns 1 when abs(a1-a2) &gt; abs(a3) and a2-a1 is negative.</p>
<p>The box function also has three arguments and works similarly to step, except that it returns 0 when abs(a1-a2) &lt;= abs(a3) and 1 otherwise.</p>
<p>The sign(a1) function returns +1 if a1 is positive, -1 if a1 is negative and 0 if a1 is 0.</p>
<p>The pc function is used to include the value proportional controls in the expression. It can have one, two or three arguments. With one argument a1 the value of pc(a1) is the value of proportional control a1 in the standard -1 to 1 range. With two arguments pc(a1, a2) also reads out control a1 but the value of the function goes from 0 t o a2. With three arguments pc(a1,a2,a3) also reads out control a1 b ut the value of the function goes from a2 to a3.</p>
<p>There are two special functions for use with the GPS sensors, these are gpsd(a1) and gpsb(a1). gpsd(a1) computes the distance in meters from the current aircraft position (as reported to the lat/long telemetry) to the GPS Point a1. gpsb(a1) returns the bearing in degrees from the current aircraft position to GPS Point a1. GPS Point 1 is special, it is the home position where the first telemetry readings for lat and long come in, or when the Reset button was last pushed on the GPS Points screen. You can create and type in additional GPS Points with your own coordinates.</p>
<p>For creating no-fly-zones, there are two additional special functions to simplify the specification of these zones, although that could also be done with lua expressions using gpsd and gpsb.</p>
<p>The function for creating no-fly-inside zones is nfi(a1,a2). The function returns 1 (true) if the aircraft is within a1 meters of the GPS Point number a2. You can create a set of GPS points for different no fly zones and then create a result expression of, for example nfi(100, 2) which will return true when the aircraft is within 100m of GPS Point 2, and 0 otherwise, and similarly for GPS Point 3 and so on.</p>
<p>There is also a function nfo(a1,a2) for creating no-fly-outside zones. nfo returns true when the aircraft position is more than a1 meters from GPS Point a2. If a2 is omitted and nfo is called as nfo(200) for example, then GPS Point 1 is used and the function returns true if the aircraft is more than 200 meters from the origin point GPS Point 1 and 0 otherwise. Typically nfo only makes sense for GPS Point 1 so the single parameter call is expected to be used most of the time.</p>
<p>If you need to use units that are not in the Jeti text entry menu we have defined special escape sequences for these units. They are .p for the percent symbol (%), and .o for the degree symbol (°).</p>
<p>For example entering a unit string of .oC will display °C as the unit string in the telemetry window and expression editing screen.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of expressions that illustrate what is possible. We can start with something simple and work up to a more complex case.</p>
<p>First, suppose you have an electric model with a battery voltage telemetry sensor you have assigned to a telemetry variable and named it Volts and a current sensor you assigned and named Amps (note that these names are case-sensitive).</p>
<p>Then you can create an expression with the Result Expression menu which is Volts * Amps and you can then rename the result from the default name to Power, and set units to Watts. You could also have Volts * Amps / 1000 and change the units to kW.</p>
<p>Second, suppose you want to have a nofly outside zone centered on the home point, GPS Point 1, of radius 1000 m. This is easy to do with the nfo function in an expression:</p>
<pre><code> nfo(1000)</code></pre>
<p>This expression will return true (numerical value of 1) when the aircraft is outside the 1000m circle, and false (numerical value 0) when inside. You can then assign a lua control to this result, and use that to make an announcement in the transmitter when you fly outside the zone.</p>
<p>Now suppose you want to also have the region behind the pilot be a no-fly zone. We do have a function gpsb(a1) that returns the bearing from the GPS point numbered a1 to the model. So if we know that at our flying field the the direction the pilot is facing while flying is 45 degrees (bearings are true direction, not magnetic .. and 45 degrees is Northeast), then we know that for bearings from 315 degrees to 135 degrees the model is in front of the pilot and for bearings outside that range the model is behind the pilot. So we could create the following result expression:</p>
<pre><code> nfo(1000) or abs(45 - gpsb(1)) &gt; 90</code></pre>
<p>This will be true if we are more than 1000 m from the home point, or the difference in bearing is more than 90 degrees from 45.</p>
<p>Third, something a little more complex. We can assume you have a pitot-static sensor with airspeed assgined to telemetry variable you have named Speed, and a vario sensor assigned to variable Vario. Then you can compute glide ratio as</p>
<pre><code> (Speed^2 - Vario^2) &gt; 0 and
 sqrt(Speed^2 - Vario^2) /
 Vario or Speed / Vario</code></pre>
<p>(the expression is split across multiple lines to make the entire expression visible on the TX screen)</p>
<p>Jeti specifies that sensors should report telemetry units in metric units, so Speed should be in m/s as should Vario. We have seen cases with third party sensors where if you change the reported units shown on the screen it also changes the reported telemetry units and in those cases you will need to check that Speed and Vario are in the same units.</p>
<p>You could then name the result expression GRatio for glide ratio. This expression uses a lua idiom where you use an expression of the form</p>
<pre><code> condition and exp1 or exp2</code></pre>
<p>Lua evaluates the condition and if true it will return the expression exp1 and if false the expression exp2. So you can see how this is being used to detect a case where the expression for glide ratio is different depending on whether the Vario value squared is larger than the Speed value squared.</p>
