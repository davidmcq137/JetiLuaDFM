<p>To have the V-SensXF app make an audio announcement that tracks a Result, use the <strong>+</strong> key to create a new line in the Announcement menu and select one of the Results which must have been previously defined from the main Result Expressions menu. You must also select an announcement type. The <strong>Reset</strong> button will delete all the announcements.</p>
<p>There are three types of announcements: <strong>Periodic</strong>, <strong>Automatic</strong> and <strong>Edge</strong>. Once you select the type on the Announcements menu, press <strong>Edit</strong> to edit the details. Each of the three types has slightly different detail screens.</p>
<p>All of the announcement type detail menus have a line to set the enable switch which enables or disables all announcements for this Result. It is set in the usual Jeti way.</p>
<p>Each Result type can also specify a custom audio file to be spoken as part of the announcements. These are wav files and are in a language-specific directory. For English, it is Apps/V-SensXF/Audio/en - other languages will have subdirectories named with their two letter localization code.</p>
<p>There are several wav files already included and you are free to add your own. You can also create new directories for other languages. We recommend creating the wav files with the TTS system at rc-thoughts.com. Many thanks to Tero for his support to our community! The app reads the language-specific audio directory at startup and will present in the menu all of the files it finds.</p>
<p>If a custom wav file is not selected, the app will announce generically, for example Result 1.</p>
<p><strong>Periodic</strong> announcements require the time between announcements in seconds. The default value is 10. You can also specify decimal places and units for the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic</strong> announcements are spaced in time according to how quickly the value of the result is changing. You set the minimum interval for when the Result is changing rapidly, and a maxiumum interval when the Result is not changing. Announcements will never be closer in time than the minimum setting, nor will the be further apart than the maximum. You also set a change scale factor, which is approximately how much the Result has to change to make a new announcement. This will depend on the range of values of Result. For example if the Result is airspeed in km/h, a value of 10 or 20 might be appropriate.You can vary the scale factor to make the announcements more or less chatty.</p>
<p><strong>Edge</strong> annoumcments are triggered when the value of the Result goes from 0 to 1 (rising edge) or 1 to 0 (falling edge). It is intended for Results which are logical values of 0 or 1, but can be used for any value of Result. The actual threshold is 0.5 as you might expect. This type of announcement is particularly useful on conjunction with the nfi, nfo, box or step functions.</p>
